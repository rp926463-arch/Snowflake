Q.1
How snowflake distribute data into stage files
e.g. I have one table with 105M records I've created stage for that same table
that stage contains 204 files
How data is distributed in these stages?

Q.2
Is there any efficient way to Copy Data from One SF table to Another
Something like Bulk Insert
If i do simple InsertInto, e.g. for 105M records it took 2m8s to copy data
Suppose i have millions of billion records. 

Q.3
Can we access data stored in snowflake table as file.
Something like external tables in hive, if not then where actually the data stored in snowflake & in what form.

Q.4
Why it is necessary to load data into snowflake stage in order to move data in and out.
file--> stage --> table
--Stage is an area which is external to the database, but that area is accessible to database(most common loactions is S3 bucket & blob storage)
--Staging area is intermediate, transit area used to process data for any of the extract, transform & load processes.
--The concept of stage is used to as temporary area where data is to be loaded can be accessed by snowflake
--Stage may be for cloud data or could be data you upload from your PC
--Data can also be staged on your local file system before loading to snowflake

CREATE STAGE <stage_name> url="cloud_storage_url" credentials="login_credentials"

Q.5
A virtual warehouse can be created or modified through the Snowflake WebUI or through SQL. Which method do you prefer and why?
--I personally prefer the SQL method for a variety of reasons.

The Snowflake WebUI doesn't show settings like "INITIALLY_SUSPENDED", "RESOURCE_MONITOR" and other parameters such as "MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL", but you can configure these settings through the SQL syntax.

Using SQL removes the dependency on the user interface, and eases any future automation.
