Q.1
How snowflake distribute data into stage files
e.g. I have one table with 105M records I've created stage for that same table
that stage contains 204 files
How data is distributed in these stages?

Q.2
Is there any efficient way to Copy Data from One SF table to Another
Something like Bulk Insert
If i do simple InsertInto, e.g. for 105M records it took 2m8s to copy data
Suppose i have millions of billion records. 

Q.3
Can we access data stored in snowflake table as file.
Something like external tables in hive, if not then where actually the data stored in snowflake & in what form.

Q.4

file--> stage --> table
		?Why
